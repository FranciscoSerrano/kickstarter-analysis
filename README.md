# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

## Overview of Project

The goal of this study was to find the trends of succesful kickstarter campagines.

### Purpose

Its purppose was to use the trends I found gain insight on what makes a campagine succeed or fail and to use that insight as an advantage in our own campaigne.

## Analysis and Challenges

Based on my analysis, I can determine the following:

* Failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. In addition, the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. In other words, if the failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it's possible that those that failed just asked for too high of a price. Since the median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects. 

* I have found that while there is only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "plays" category is the most successful.

* The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May. On the other hand, December doesn't seem like a great time to launch a campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In the image above you can clearly see a trend where May is a very successful month. Also, December appeaers to be the worst performing month for campaignes. One can assume that holiday season doesnt put people in am ood to donate to fundraisers.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In this analysis its easy to conclude that that there are certain goal ranges that give an increase chance of successful funding. With goals less than $1,000 having the best chance and those chances diminishing as the goal increases. An intresting finding is that goals between $35,000 and $45,000 appear to have a higher chance than surrounding ranges but the sample is too small to for this to be significant. In general, smaller goals are funded more often.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Some challenges faced during this analysis where:

* Figuring out what data is meaningful what data is not.
* Finding value in the relevant data.
* Drawing insight based on the vizualizations.

I can assume that as time goes on I will start to develop an intuition around these challenges. I can't imagine them remaining challenges for long. (:


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. May is significantly more likely to yeild funded projects.
2. December is the worst time to launch

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

In general, smaller goals are funded more often and larger goals are more likely to fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The most obvious limitation is that this set only includes monetary goals, time frames, and pass/fail data. One of the largest contributors to the success of a Kickstarter is its video describing the product/service and the tiers of rewards for donating to the project. These two factors could significantly change the strategy one comes up with. As even a bad product with a great video/rewards could get funded or a great product with an awful video/rewards would fail.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Other tables that could yeild interesting results could be a pie chart that shows the allocation of success or failure based on catagory. Or even a treemap that shows the catagories and their respresentation in the entire set.
