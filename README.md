# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

The goal of this study was to find the trends of succesful kickstarter campagines

Based on our analysis, we can determine the following:

Failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. In addition, the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. In other words, if the failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it's possible that those that failed just asked for too high of a price. Since the median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects. 

I have found that while there is only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "plays" category is the most successful.

The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May. On the other hand, December doesn't seem like a great time to launch a campaign.
